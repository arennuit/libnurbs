.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fInurbs++-config\fP is a tool that is used to configure to determine
the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link
programs that use \fInurbs++\fP. It is also used internally to the .m4
macros for GNU autoconf that are included with \fInurbs++\fP.

\fInurbs++-config\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of \fInurbs++\fP on the standard
output.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a \fInurbs++\fP
program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a \fInurbs++\fP
program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix
Print the prefix with which \fInurbs++\fP was compiled.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that

prefix if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be
specified before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
