This is the NURBS++ library a library to manipulate and create NURBS curves 
and surfaces.

The information about the library are available from the website at
	http://yukon.genie.uottawa.ca/~lavoie/software/nurbs

Knowing myself, I'll only have time to update information in one format.
This is why all the documentation are available online and not in the
library.

Sorry for any inconvenience this might cause.

Sincerly,
