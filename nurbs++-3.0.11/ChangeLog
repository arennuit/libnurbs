      - Fixed compilation problems under VC++ 6.0
      - Temporarly removed Image Magick suppot

      - Fixing linking problems with X11 and OpenGL
      - Known BUG: Image Magick causes core dump under Linux.
      - Added pointer initialization for NurbsCurveArray
      - globalInterpD know uses the same knot vector generation method
	as the one described inside the algorithm A9.2.5 of the NURBS
	book.
3.0.6: (1999-5-7)
      - Fixed the problem about setting the SHELL variable
      - Using UncondessImage instead of UncompressImage for Image Magick
      - Fixing compilation in another directory. If you do 
	'mkdir compile; cd compile ; ../configure ; make ', 
	it will work.
      -	Configure is smarter about OpenGL
      - Fixing linking with the OpenGL option.
3.0.5: (1999-5-5)
      - Fixing linking problems in platforms other than Solaris with egcs.
3.0.4: (1999-5-4)
      - Added routines to remove numerical inacuracies when making 
	a circle or a surface of revolution when the angle needed
	is 2 PI. The area function now returns a proper value for
	a sphere generated by makeSphere.
      - Added a flop function to the Matrix class.
      - Added a routine to create a torus (makeTorus).
      - Fixed bad version string for libtool.

3.0.3: (1999-4-30) 
      - Added support for VRML97 output files. Also known as VRML 2.0.
      - Fixed linking problem with a static library under Solaris.
      - Added missing template instantiation for Linux with OpenGL.

3.0.2: (1999-4-28) 	
      - Fixed linking problems under Linux
      - Added missing config_mvc.bat file for windows VC++ 6.0.
      - Include files are installed inside ${prefix}/include/nurbs++
      - Fixed writePS problem with open curves.
      - Added warning when inserting a knot outside of a valid clamped region.
      - Added the clamp and unclamp functions.

3.0.1: (1999-4-22) 
      - Make dist now works
      - Fixed mkinstalldirs
      - A new read/write format. The size of the data type is now stored 
	inside the file.
      - Fixed problems when linking with the double version of the library
      - Added ctrlPnts(i,j) to access P(i,j)
      - Added ctrlPnts(i) to access P[i]

3.0.0: (1999-4-19)
      - Use of inlined member functions instead of const references to 
	internal data.
      - New namespace PLib instead of Phil_Library
      - The matrix and nurbs packages are merged into the same directory
	hierarchy.
